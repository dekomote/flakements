Flakements is cross-breed between pyflakes + pep8 and pygments. It's a linter tool that enhances pyflakes + pep8 with additional graphical element - shows the code and highlights the problematic lines. It can be also used as api - the function check_source is a wrapper around pyflakes, and when used with code text, returns a dict with line number, offset and error message. pep8_code uses pep8 script and parses its output to generate compatible dict with the previous function.
